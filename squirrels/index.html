          <p><p><em>Squirrels</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Orphans</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the baby has actually been orphaned. If baby has just fallen out of the tree and isnt injured or seen near a cat, place in a warm box and put it at the base of the tree. Can try to rub the squirrel to make it 'scream'. Put the squirrel in the box and walk at least 30 feet away. Getting out of view is best so mom (if shes around) will feel comfortable enough to come down and get the baby and take it back to the nest. Leave baby alone for 1-2 hours. if this time has lapsed, baby may indeed be orphaned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeding</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehydration solution: 1 tsp salt, 3 tsp sugar, 4 cups luke warm water --&gt; This will make an ok homemade rehydration solution in a pinch. Bare in mind that pedialyte is much better to use.</li>
<li>Esbilac is ok to use, add whipping cream to it (5-25ml/cup). start at 5ml and increase cream. if loose stool develops, decrease cream. For solid esbilac powder; 2 parts water: 1 part esbilac powder + 1/4 part heavy whipping cream. though fox valley formula is better.</li>
<li>Feed squirrels about 5-7% of body weight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Husbandry</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Tea Tree oil topically on penis to prevent penis suckling by other squirrels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medication</p>
<ul>
<li>Streptomycin and procaine penicillin toxic to rats and mice and probably are for squirrels</li>
<li>Cat bites:<ul>
<li>older than 5ish weeks: clavamox 20mg/kg, metacam 0.2 mg/kg loading then 0.1mg/kg maintenance</li>
<li>young squirrels: TMS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal parasites: Albon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aging</p>
<ul>
<li>Eastern Gray Squirrel. Weights vary drastically depending on geographic location. More northern living gray squirrels weigh more than southern living gray squirrels.</li>
